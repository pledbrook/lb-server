A Bintray proxy server for [lazybones](https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones).

This is a Ratpack app, so it is started by running `gradle run` from the project root directory.

This server requires two environment variables to be set before it is run: 

- `BINTRAY_USER` - the user name for the Bintray API basic HTTP authentication
- `BINTRAY_API_KEY` - the API key for the Bintray API basic HTTP authentication
